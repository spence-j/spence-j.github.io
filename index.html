  <h1>Graphic Design Criticism<br>
    as a Spectator Sport</h1>

  <span>Part Two</span>
  <p class="secondary-text">Everybody Wants to Go to Harvard</p>
  <p>Earlier last year, the University of California quietly unveiled a new logo. Much has changed since 2009, including
    the
    notion that you can quietly unveil a logo. The logo was, eventually, inevitably noticed.</p>
  <p>After Tropicana, after the "epic fail" Gap debacle, after the seizure-inducing London 2012 affair,
    no one should have been surprised by what happened next. In fact, you almost had a sense that
    we all knew our roles in the drama to come: New logo? Game on! Graphic design criticism is now
    a spectator sport, and anyone can play</p>
  <p class="red-text">Creating a beautiful design is just the first step in a long and challenging process with
    no guarantee of success. Users hardly welcome change, but as a designer, you can assure your audience that the new
    change will grow on them. In other words, you must sell it by educating our audience to understand the process and
    context of the change.</p>
  <p>The review on Brand New, Armin Vit's amazingly popular logo review website, was mixed. The new UC logo was
    contemporary
    and abstract, and sat at the center of a smart and attractive new visual system, a very professional job by the
    University's in-house design team.</p>
  <p>Significantly, it was meant to represent the University of California system, the holding company,
    in effect, for UCLA, UC Berkeley, UC Davis, and the other schools in the network. All of them would keep their
    existing
    logos. Brand New commenters tend to be other graphic designers. Some liked it,
    some didn't.
  </p>
  <p>There was no such ambivalence on the part of the UC community of students, faculty and alumni. They basically went
    crazy
    with rage. A petition on Change.org — "Stop the new UC logo" — got over 54,000 signatures.</p>
  <p>The outcry spread to the general press coverage, who called it "one of the worst logo rebrands
    in history", "revolting" and "a fiasco." Some in the graphic design community attempted to rally around the
    embattled
    designers, including Armin Vit, who wrote a none-too-subtle response to the critics that included the suggestion:
    "Shut
    up. Seriously. Shut up."</p>
  <p>The University held their ground for a week or so before capitulating. Said Daniel M. Dooley, UC's senior vice
    president
    for external relations: "While I believe the design element in question" — you can almost hear him choking on the
    word
    logo — "would win wide acceptance over time, it also
    is important that we listen to and respect what has been a significant negative response by students, alumni and
    other
    members of our community." "Pleasant news," said the opponents.
    "Awesome victory."</p>
